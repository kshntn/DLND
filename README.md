# Welcome to my Projects from the Deep Learning Nanodegree

## About
This is a repository for documenting my education of Deep Learning. It includes the projects and tutorials I completed sucessfully from the Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). I have built convolutional networks for image recognition, recurrent neural networks for sequence generation, generative adversarial networks for image generation, and also learnt to deploy models accessible from a website.


##Contents

### Tutorials
* [Introduction to Neural Networks](https://github.com/kshntn/DLND/blob/master/Analyzing%20Student%20Data/StudentAdmissions.ipynb): Implemented gradient descent and applied it to predict patterns in student admissions data.
* [Sentiment Analysis with NumPy](https://github.com/kshntn/DLND/blob/master/Sentiment%20Analysis/Sentiment_Classification_Projects.ipynb): [Andrew Trask](http://iamtrask.github.io/) leads you through building a sentiment analysis model, predicting if some text is positive or negative.
