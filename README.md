# My Projects from the Deep Learning Nanodegree

## About
This is a repository for documenting my education of Deep Learning. It includes the projects and tutorials I completed sucessfully from the Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). I have built convolutional networks for image recognition, recurrent neural networks for sequence generation, generative adversarial networks for image generation, and also learnt to deploy models accessible from a website.


## Contents

### Tutorials
* [Introduction to Neural Networks](https://github.com/kshntn/DLND/blob/master/Analyzing%20Student%20Data/StudentAdmissions.ipynb): Implemented gradient descent and applied it to predict patterns in student admissions data.
* [Sentiment Analysis with NumPy](https://github.com/kshntn/DLND/blob/master/Sentiment%20Analysis/Sentiment_Classification_Projects.ipynb): [Andrew Trask](http://iamtrask.github.io/) built a sentiment analysis model, for predicting if some text is positive or negative.
* [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/kshntn/DLND/tree/master/Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks): Visualized the output of layers that make up a CNN. Learnt to define and train a CNN for classifying [MNIST data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database), a handwritten digit database that is notorious in the fields of machine and deep learning. Also, defined and trained a CNN for classifying images in the [CIFAR10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).
* [Transfer Learning](https://github.com/kshntn/DLND/blob/master/Transfer%20Learning/Transfer_Learning_Exercise.ipynb): Used **pre-trained** networks such as VGGnet to help to classify images of flowers without training an end-to-end network from scratch.
* [Autoencoders](https://github.com/kshntn/DLND/tree/master/Convolutional%20Autoencoder): Built models for image compression and de-noising, using feedforward and convolutional networks in PyTorch.
* [Style Transfer](https://github.com/kshntn/DLND/blob/master/Style%20Transfer/Style_Transfer_Exercise.ipynb): Extracted style and content features from images, using a pre-trained network. Implemented style transfer according to the paper, [Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) by Gatys et. al. Defined appropriate losses for iteratively creating a target, style-transferred image of our own design!
* [Intro to Recurrent Networks (Time series & Character-level RNN)](https://github.com/kshntn/DLND/tree/master/RNN): Implemented Recurrent neural networks which are able to use information about the sequence of data, such as the sequence of characters in the text, for generating sentiments in the words.
* [Embeddings (Word2Vec)](https://github.com/kshntn/DLND/tree/master/Embedding%20and%20Word2Vec): Implemented the Word2Vec model to find semantic representations of words for use in natural language processing.
* [Sentiment Analysis RNN](https://github.com/kshntn/DLND/blob/master/RNN/Sentiment%20Prediction/Sentiment_RNN_Exercise.ipynb): Implemented a recurrent neural network that can predict if the text of a moview review is positive or negative.
* [Generative Adversarial Network on MNIST](https://github.com/kshntn/DLND/blob/master/GANs/MNIST%20GAN/MNIST_GAN_Exercise.ipynb): Trained a simple generative adversarial network on the MNIST dataset.
* [Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)](https://github.com/kshntn/DLND/blob/master/GANs/DCGAN/DCGAN_Exercise.ipynb): Implemented a DCGAN to generate new images based on the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset.
* [CycleGAN](https://github.com/kshntn/DLND/blob/master/GANs/CycleGAN/CycleGAN_Exercise.ipynb): Implemented a CycleGAN that is designed to learn from unpaired and unlabeled data; used trained generators to transform images from summer to winter and vice versa.



### Projects

* [Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns](https://github.com/kshntn/DLND/tree/master/Project%20-1/first_neural_network-265150): Implemented a neural network in NumPy to predict bike rentals.
* [Dog Breed Classifier](https://github.com/kshntn/DLND/tree/master/Project%20-2): Built a convolutional neural network with PyTorch to classify any image (even an image of a face) as a specific dog breed.
* [TV Script Generation](https://github.com/kshntn/DLND/tree/master/Project-3): Trained a recurrent neural network to generate scripts in the style of dialogue from Seinfeld Season.
* [Face Generation](https://github.com/kshntn/DLND/tree/master/Project-4): Used a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of new and realistic human faces.
* [Deploying a Model (with AWS SageMaker)](https://github.com/kshntn/DLND/tree/master/Project-5) Deployed pre-trained models using AWS SageMaker. Constructed a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. Deployed the model and constructed a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.
