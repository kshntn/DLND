# Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model on AWS SageMaker
## Project Overview

In this project, I used [AWS SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) to construct a complete project from end to end. The goal of this project is to have a simple web page which a user can use to enter a movie review. The web page will then send the review off to my deployed model which will predict the sentiment of the entered review.
